## <center>Introduction</center>
This is a dedicated space to share some of my ideas and opinions about general topics in this fascinating world of informatics.
Talking about the exterior (referring to the aesthetic), the blog's design is very simple, a simplicity that I like and that brings me calm, perhaps for other readers as well. Internally, the blog is made with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and for my own convenience, I use the **Markdown** markup language for everything you see in it, including this page.

## <center>About Me</center>
Husband, father and self-taught programmer. I was born in the Dominican Republic, a beautiful country and where the sun seems to be closer than any other place in the world. My native language is Spanish, but I also speak English, and sometimes I receive Lithuanian lessons from my lovely wife. Now, speaking about technology, I like to know how things internally work, and for that reason, driven by the fun and curiosity (and as a challenge for myself) I like to [reinvent the wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel) using [Java](https://dev.java/) if it is possible. Also I like the [D](https://dlang.org/) programming language. By the way, my name is &#x42;&#x72;&#x61;&#x79;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x20;&#x52;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x6e;; it is a pleassure to have you around.
